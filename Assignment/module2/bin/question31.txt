31. What happens if the parent and the child class have a field with same identifier? B16. Are constructors and initializers
    also inherited to sub-classes?

Ans - If both the parent (superclass) and the child (subclass) have a field with the same identifier (i.e., same variable name),
      the field in the child class shadows the one in the parent class. This means that when you access the field in an instance
      of the child class, it refers to the child's version of the field, not the parent's.

      Constructors and initializers are not inherited by subclasses in object-oriented programming languages like Dart. However,
      the subclass can call the parent class's constructor using super().
