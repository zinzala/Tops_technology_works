33. How do you implement multiple inheritance in Dart?

Ans - Dart does not support multiple inheritance (i.e., a class cannot directly inherit from more than one class). However,
      Dart provides alternatives to achieve similar functionality using:

      - Mixins
      - Interfaces

      Both of these techniques allow us to share behavior and functionality between multiple classes without inheriting from
      more than one class.
