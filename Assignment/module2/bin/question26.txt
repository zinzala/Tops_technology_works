26. Can we overload static method in Dart?

Ans - we cannot overload static methods in Dart. Dart does not support method overloading in the traditional sense
      (i.e., defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or counts). All method names,
      whether static or instance methods, must be unique within the scope of a class.
