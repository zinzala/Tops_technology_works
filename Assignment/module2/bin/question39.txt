39. What are the rules of method overriding in Dart?

Ans - In Dart, method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined
      in its superclass. When overriding a method, there are certain rules and best practices that need to be followed to ensure
      that the override is valid and behaves as expected.

      1 Same Method Signature
      2 Use of the @override Annotation
      3 Accessing the Superclass Method
      4 Visibility (Public, Private)
      5 Return Type Covariance
      6 Parameter Types Must Match
      7 Optional Parameters:
                - If the superclass method uses optional parameters (named or positional), the overriding method should also
                  include them, maintaining the same optional parameters in the same order.
