24. Difference between inheritance and polymorphism

Ans -                       Inheritance                                              polymorphism
           - A mechanism where one class acquires the properties       A mechanism that allows different classes to be treated
             and behaviors of a parent class.                          as instances of the same class through a common interface.

           - Deals with a "is-a" relationship between classes          Focuses on "many forms" where a method or function can
             (e.g., Dog is a Animal).                                  behave differently based on the object.

           - Achieved by extending a base class or implementing        Achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism).
             interfaces.
