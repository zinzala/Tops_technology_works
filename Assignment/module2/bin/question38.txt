38. How do you prevent overriding a Dart method without using the final modifier?

Ans - In Dart, if we want to prevent a method from being overridden in a subclass without using the final modifier,
      we can achieve this by marking the method as private using an underscore (_) as a prefix. A private method is
      only accessible within the same library and cannot be overridden by subclasses that are outside of that library.
