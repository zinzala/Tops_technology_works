41. What happens when a class implements two interfaces and both declare field (variable) with same name?

Ans - In Dart, interfaces don't declare fields (variables) directly; they can only declare methods (including getters and setters).
      If a class implements two interfaces that both have getters or setters with the same name, we must resolve the conflict by
      providing our own implementation for the conflicting member in the class that implements both interfaces.
