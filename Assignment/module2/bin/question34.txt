34. Can a class extend by itself in Dart?

Ans - No, a class in Dart cannot extend itself. Dart (and most object-oriented programming languages) does not allow a class to
      extend itself because it would create an infinite recursive relationship, which would be illogical and result in compilation
      errors.
