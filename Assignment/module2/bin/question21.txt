21. What is inheritance?

Ans -   inheritance in programming is a feature that allow object to acquire properties and methods of other object.
        because of this feature instead of writing same code in multiple class we can inherit properties and methods
        of Base class into derived class. thus code Reusability is one of the benefit of inheritance.

        for example :

        class Animal{

        }

        class Dog extends Animal{

        }


        in the above example Animal is Base_class and Dog is Derived_class. as you see in the above example ' extends '
        keyword is used to inherit properties and method.
