28. Can an interface extend more than one interface in Dart?

Ans - Yes, in Dart, an interface can extend more than one interface. This allows a class that implements that interface to
      inherit behavior from multiple interfaces. In Dart, every class is an interface, and you can define an interface by
      simply creating a class without method implementations or by using abstract classes.
