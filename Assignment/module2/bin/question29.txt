29. What will happen if a class implements two interfaces and they both have a method with same name and signature?

Ans - When a class implements two interfaces that both have a method with the same name and signature, the class must provide
      a single implementation of that method. In Dart, unlike some other languages, there is no ambiguity in this scenario
      because Dart doesn't provide multiple inheritance. The implementing class is responsible for overriding the method and
      providing its functionality.
