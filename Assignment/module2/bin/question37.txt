37. What the order is of extends and implements keyword on Dart class declaration?

Ans - In Dart, when you declare a class that both extends a class (single inheritance) and implements interfaces,
      the correct order is:

      1 extends comes first

      2 implements comes after

      for example

      class MyClass extends ParentClass implements Interface1, Interface2 {

      }
