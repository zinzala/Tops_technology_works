22. Which inheritance is not supported by Dart? Why? B3. What is advantage of inheritance?

Ans -   Dart does not support Multiple inheritance. This means that a derived class can not directly inherit from more than
        one Base class.

        The reason is to avoid the complexity and ambiguity that arises from it. The most common issue with multiple inheritance
        is the Diamond Problem, where a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common parent class. This leads
        to ambiguity about which version of a method or property the child class should inherit.

        for example :

                     A
                   /   \
                  B     C
                   \   /
                     D

        As you see in the above example the Derived class(D) inherits from two Base class B and C. class B and C inherits
        class A. this leads to diamond problem.

        Advantage of inheritance is as follows:
        1. code reusability
        2. allow to add new feature to existing classes
        3. create hierarchy structure for classes
