30. Can we pass an object of a subclass to a method expecting an object of the super class? B14. Are static members
    inherited to subclasses?

Ans - Yes, in Dart (and in object-oriented programming in general), we can pass an object of a subclass to a method that
      expects an object of the superclass. This is due to polymorphism, which allows a subclass object to be treated as an
      instance of its superclass.

      In Dart, static members (including static methods and static variables) are not inherited in the same way that
      instance members are. Instead, static members belong to the class itself rather than to instances of the class.
